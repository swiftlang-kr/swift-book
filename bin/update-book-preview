# Updates the GitHub Pages documentation site that's published from the 'docs'
# subdirectory in the 'gh-pages' branch of this repository.
#
# This script should be run by someone with commit access to the 'gh-pages' branch
# at a regular frequency so that the documentation content on the GitHub Pages site
# is up-to-date with the content in this repo.
#
# To use top-of-tree DocC, clone the following repositories:
#
#     https://github.com/apple/swift-docc
#     https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-render
#
# Then set environment variables to paths in their working directories,
# like the following, before running this script:
#
#     DOCC_EXEC=~/git/DocC/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/docc
#     DOCC_HTML_DIR=~/git/DocC-Renderer/dist/
